Post request to /entry - which contain atleast a "video_id" and "preview" link from Deezer

## Getting Started

### Locally

#### Pre-requisites 
 - Docker
 - Git and EB CLI
 - .env file with VIS_URL specified as 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/visualize'
 - (optional) .env file with variables: S3_BUCKET, S3_KEY, S3_SECRET_KEY

#### Create Docker Image

 1) Clone repo for artificial-artist-ds
 2) In command line run:

        docker build -t <tag-name> <path of repo>
        docker run -it -d -p 5000:5000 <image-name(tag)>

 3) create a post request and send to http://127.0.0.1:5000/entry
    - Post should include a dictionary with 'params' as first index, and its value will be a dictionary with the keys and values for 'preview' & 'video_id' at a minimum.

    - Example using python:

            import requests

            data = {'params': 
                    {'video_id': 'name_of_video', 
                    'preview': 'url to mp3 file here'
                    }}

            requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/entry', json=data)
